          <p>
            There are almost as many travel apps out there as there are travel
            destinations. In general, they all do some things well, and some
            things not so well. WikiCamps is certainly in the same, erm, camp.
            With a focus on – you guessed it – camping, the app can help you
            find nearby places to pitch your tent, park your RV, or take in some
            local sites. And while it can certainly be helpful, the app also
            suffers from so not-so-great features that might make it not worth
            paying to own it.

            Beyond the actual data it contains (or doesn’t contain), WikiCamps
            has a wealth of smart features. Tap the hamburger button in the
            top-left of the screen, and you’re presented with a list of nearby
            attractions, campgrounds, hotels and more. Or you can enter a
            destination to see what might be in the area where you intend to
            travel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tap on any one attraction and, if available, you’ll find contact
            details, photos, web links, user ratings and a mapping button that
            lets you load directions into your favorite mapping app such as
            Wayze, Google Maps or TomTom Go. You also get a week-long weather
            forecast for the site. Plus, because this is a Wiki built by
            members, you can edit the site if you notice that something is wrong
            or if you want to add additional information or photos, and you can
            also leave and read reviews from other users.
          </p>
          <p>
            A filter button lets you sort sites according to what you’re looking
            for and helps clear the clutter. You can for example, switch the
            toggles to include only free campgrounds that accept pets and have
            water facilities. You can see results either on the map or the list.
            One unfortunate thing is that the app seems to use Google Maps, so
            you wind up seeing all of the destinations that Google provides, but
            they aren’t all clickable so things can get a bit confusing.

            Like many apps, WikiCamps comes with a 14-day free trial. After
            that, it costs a one-time payment of $1.99 for lifetime access. The
            free trial period is well worth it because you can try out different
            destinations to see just how well it will work for you. Many users
            report a lack of data on local attractions and campsites, while our
            tests were data rich, so it might just depend on where you’re
            looking. It seems WikiCamps has a strong following in Australia, so
            the crowd-sourced information it relies on might just take some time
            to fill in around the rest of the world.
